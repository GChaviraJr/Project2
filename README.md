Brewery Crawl is an app that allows a user to search for an establishment in any inputted city, and gives them the option to send a text to a friend, or a group of friends with the name and address of the establishment, and the time they are planning to meet.

This version includes a registration and sign in that allows the user to use the app. Yelp is used to pull up the establishments within the chosen city, and Twilio is used to send the text messages. The establishments shown are stored in a MySQL database, while the given message information is stored in Firebase. 

Once registered, the user has access to the full app. The user will:

      1. Sign in with Email and password used to register
      
      2. Enter the city of their choosing
      
      3. Input the name and number of whomever they want to send a message to, as well as the time of the meet up
      
      4. Click "Submit" to display the names of the chosen friends
      
      5. Click "Send Invite" to send a text message to all of the people in the list
